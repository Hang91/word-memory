# word-memory

## Movivation
This project is for English learners to memorize english words.

Sometimes, when I recall the days in which I prepared for GRE and TOEFL, I remember the endless word lists and the frustration that I cannot recollect the meaning of a word that I memorized yesterday. Although memorizing a single word is a simple task, I still believe that the most boring and chanllenging thing is word-memory. Comparing to other learning process, you will spend more time on word-memory to get the feel that what you have done is really useful and helpful. 

For example, some algorithm and mathematic theory is hard to learn and understand. But, after we complete the learning process, we can get the feel of achievement by using the algorithm to solve problems. Then, the feel will inspire you to learn more algorithms. We call the process a "learning cycle" in this doc. On the contrary, word-memory cannot provide you the feel of achievement until your vocabulary increase noticeably. In a short, the "learning cycle" is large.

To shrink the size of the "learning cycle" of word-memory, we are going to provide some functions in this project.

## Framework
We will use Golang as the primary coding language, MongoDB as database.
